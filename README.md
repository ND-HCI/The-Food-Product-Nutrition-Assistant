## Step-by-Step Instructions:

### 1. Initialize Custom GPT Model
Begin by creating a new Custom GPT model on the ChatGPT platform. This serves as the foundation for your tailored nutrition assistant.

### 2. Access Configuration Settings
Navigate to the 'Configure Settings' area of your Custom GPT model. This section allows you to customize the model according to your specific needs.

### 3. Incorporate Instruction Template
Within the 'Instructions' tab, paste the provided Instruction Template. This template outlines the operational framework and response behavior for the GPT, ensuring it aligns with the objectives of a nutrition assistant.

### 4. Select Relevant Conversation Starters
Choose or create conversation starters that focus on evaluating the healthiness of food items. These prompts will guide users in initiating meaningful dialogues with the GPT about nutrition.

### 5. Upload Essential Knowledge Sources
Import pertinent knowledge sources into the 'Knowledge' section. These documents or data should enrich the GPT's understanding of nutrition, dietary recommendations, and related health information.

### 6. Integrate Nutrition Facts Label Dataset
Upload a dataset containing Nutrition Facts Labels for the products you wish to analyze. This step enhances the GPT's capability to offer specific nutritional insights. Optionally, you can also design prompts that instruct the GPT to refer to this dataset for information.

### 7. Engage with Custom GPT
Finally, interact with your Custom GPT model by prompting it with a specific product and dietary goals. The model will utilize the configured instructions, knowledge sources, and dataset to generate tailored nutritional advice.

By following these steps, you will successfully create a Food Product Nutrition Assistant Custom GPT, capable of providing expert nutritional guidance based on the principles outlined in the CHI24 paper. This custom model will serve as a valuable tool for anyone seeking informed dietary recommendations.
